  <h2>
    <li>What is lexical structure?</li>
  </h2>
  <p>
    A programming language‚Äôs lexical structure specifies a set of some basic rules about how code should be written in it. Rules like what variable names look like, the delimiter characters for comments, and how one program statement is separated from the next. It is the lowest-level syntax of a language.

  <h2>
    <li>What is Unicode?</li>
  </h2>
  <p>The Unicode Standard provides a unique number for every character, no matter what platform, device, application or language. It has been adopted by all modern software providers and now allows data to be transported through many different platforms, devices and applications without corruption. Support of Unicode forms the foundation for the representation of languages and symbols in all major operating systems, search engines, browsers, laptops, and smart phones‚Äîplus the Internet and World Wide Web (URLs, HTML, XML, CSS, JSON, etc.). Supporting Unicode is the best way to implement ISO/IEC 10646.</p>

  <h2>
    <li>What are shorthand operators, explain with a suitable example?</li>
  </h2>
  <p>
  If you‚Äôre adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, or remaindering two values, there‚Äôs no need to type out the entire equation. Use these shorthands to save time and code:
  <br>
    <b>
    x = x + y    ->    x += y<br>
    x = x - y    ->    x -= y<br>
    x = x * y    ->    x *= y<br>
    x = x / y    ->    x /= y<br>
    x = x % y    ->    x %= y
    </b>
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>
    <li>What is ‚Äúuse Strict‚Äù in JavaScript?</li>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <b>"use strict";</b> Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".<br>
    Strict mode is added to the beginning of a script or a function.<br>
    Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript. Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.<br>
    As an example, in normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable.
    <br>
    <code>
    "use strict";
    myFunction();
    function myFunction() {
    y = 3.14;   // This will also cause an error because y is not declared
    }
    </code>
  </p>
</ol>
