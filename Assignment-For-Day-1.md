      <tr>
        <td>Client-side developers focus on creating the part of a website that the user can interact with. Sometimes, client-side development is also referred to as front-end development, as it focuses on the "front" part of an application that users can see. </td>
        <td>Server-side developers focus on behind-the-scenes development, and server-side development is also referred to as "back-end" development. </td>

      <td>In client-side scripting, scripts simply run on a device. Often, client-side scripts run in a browser.</td>
      <td>Server-side scripts, however, run on a web server.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Client-side programs tend to be less secure, as users are often able to see and interact with them.</td>
      <td>However, because users can't see or interact with server-side source code, server-side programs often have higher levels of security than client-side programs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Client-side developers complete a variety of tasks, including:
        <ul>
          <li> Creating website layouts </li>
          <li> Designing user interfaces </li>
          <li> Adding form validation </li>
          <li> Adding visual elements like colors and fonts </li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        Common server-side tasks include:
        <ul>
          <li> Coding dynamic websites </li>
          <li> Developing web applications </li>
          <li> Connecting websites to databases</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Some common client-side languages include:
        <ul>
          <li> HTML </li>
          <li> CSS </li>
          <li> Javascript </li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        Server-side developers can use many different programming languages, including:
        <ul>
          <li> Java </li>
          <li> Python </li>
          <li> SQL </li>

  <h2>
    <li>What is Nodejs?</li>
  </h2>
  Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js is a popular, lightweight web framework for beginners, and it is used by many big companies like Netflix and Uber.
  <br>
  <h2>
    <li>Explain Scope in JavaScript</li>
  </h2>
  The current context of execution. The context in which values and expressions are "visible" or can be referenced. If a variable or other expression is not "in the current scope," then it is unavailable for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.
  <br>
  <h2>
    <li>JavaScript is asynchronous or synchronous.</li>
  </h2>
  <p>In synchronous operations, operation are performed one at a time. The next operation is unblocked only when the ongoing operation is completed.
    Simple words, you need to wait for a operation in progress to finish, in order to start the next one in the queue.
  </p>
  <p>In asynchronous operations, the next operation can be started before the previous one finishes.
    Asynchronous programming allows to handling of multiple requests simultaneously, thereby allowing to accomplish more tasks within shorter time span.
  </p>
  <h5>
  So what is JavaScript?
  <h5>
  <p>At its core, JavaScript is by default Synchronous in nature.<br>
    Let's break it down:
    It is Synchronous because it is Single-threaded. In single-thread one operation is executed at a time.
    It blocks other operations in queue, as they need to wait until the previous operation has completed execution.
  </p>
  <p>In nutshell:
    In JavaScript, only one operation will be executed at a time and the successive operations in stack need to wait until the ongoing operation is completed.
  </p>
  <p>The developers manipulate JavaScript to behave Asynchronously. To make this manipulation, there are 3 techniques:
  <ol>
    <li>Callback function</li>
    <li>Promises</li>
    <li>Async/Await</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>
    <li>JavaScript is Single-threaded or Multi-threaded.</li>
  </h2>
  <p>JS is a single threaded which means only one statement is executed at a time.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>
    <li>Explain DOM in your own word.</li>
  </h2>
  <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
    A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
